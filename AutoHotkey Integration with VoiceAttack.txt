[b]What is it?[/b]
The attached VoiceAttack profile provides the means to use AutoHotkey functionality within the VoiceAttack environment through C# inline functions. This project (VA-AHK.Integration) expands VoiceAttack's capabilities, provides more control over AutoHotkey processing, and enables easy communication between AutoHotkey and VoiceAttack. And you don't even need to have the AutoHotkey software installed. 

So in summary this functionality may be useful for folks who use AutoHotkey scripts in conjunction with VoiceAttack and want:
[list]
[li]Greater control over AutoHotkey script execution via VoiceAttack[/li]
[li]A simple framework for passing variable data back and forth between AutoHotkey and VoiceAttack[/li]
[/list]

[b]Why would you do this?[/b]
During the early development of the (now obsolete) [url=http://voiceattack.com/SMF/index.php?topic=1312.0][u] Physical keyboard & mouse input blocking[/u][/url] profile I did a lot of research on how to use AutoHotkey to accomplish the task. In doing so I discovered [url=https://github.com/amazing-andrew/AutoHotkey.Interop][u]amazing-andrew's AutoHotkey.Interop[/u][/url] project on GitHub and I decided to take on the challenge of adapting his work for use with VoiceAttack. 

I'm guessing that 98% of users will have no need for this...but that's okay :)
